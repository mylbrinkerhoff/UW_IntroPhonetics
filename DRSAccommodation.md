[LING 450/550] DRS Accommodation

Hi [NAME], 

I just wanted to let you know that I received your DRS accommodations. Thank you so much for sending them to me. 

I finished reviewing them and look forward to having you in class. If there is anything else you need or would like to talk to me about, or let me know if there is anything else I can do to help with your learning please let me know. 

Best, 
Myke
