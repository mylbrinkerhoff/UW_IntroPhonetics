  abstract = {"This broad, interdisciplinary textbook investigates how speech can be written down, how speech is produced, its acoustic characteristics, and how listeners perceive speech. Phonetics: Transcription, Production, Acoustics, and Perception introduces readers to the fundamental concepts of the discipline, providing coverage of all four areas of phonetics. This comprehensive textbook also familiarizes readers with concepts from other disciplines related to phonetics--such as physiology, anatomy, and psychology--through relatable, real-life examples. Now in its second edition, the text has been substantially revised to improve clarity and currency, based on student feedback received by the authors over the past decade. Brief "Nutshell" introductions have been added to all chapters to provide a clear overview of key points within the body of the text. Expanded content to this new edition examines voice quality, the acoustic correlates of different phonation types, intonation, and different theories of speech perception. Written in a clear and concise style by two of the field's leading scholars, this textbook: Covers related relevant areas, including vocal fold vibration and the physiology of the ear. Offers examples from other languages to highlight aspects of phonetics not found in English. Includes chapter-by-chapter exercises, engaging illustrations, and a detailed glossary. Features a companion website containing additional resources such as figures and sound files. Is taught in nearly every linguistics department as a required course for undergraduates majoring in linguistics. It is also taught in speech sciences / speech pathology. There are books that cater specifically to this market but there's a fair number of instructors in Communication/Speech Science departments who use books written by linguists"--},
